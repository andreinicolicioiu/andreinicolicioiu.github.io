abstract: "Long range interactions in the scene represent key el-
ements in solving numerous visual tasks. While convolu-
tional models have been extensively studied, newer meth-
ods like graph neural networks have been gaining track in
recent time. We investigate the capacities of current models
to capture distant connections by studying theoretically and
empirically the effective receptive field of graph models.
We prove that the outputs of Graph Convolutional Net-
works are influenced by regions where it is highly probable
to arrive in several steps, while Self-Attention depends more
on the regions that are strongly correlated with the consid-
ered location. We show that graph models achieve superior
results when distant connections are essential and we em-
pirically confirm our theoretically findings."
